            Swift Accelerator Program is an 8 month program where students are
            trained to create iOS apps using Xcode and learn simple design with
            Figma. After going through fundementals of building an iOS app,
            students form a group to create an app to benefit society. Senior
            consultants there helped to provide valuable insights on
            brainstorming and feedback on how to improve the app. Together, my
            group created an app called Wishey, a budgeting app which targets
            young adults, to allow them to track their monthly budget, expenses
            and income. It also provides insights on their spending by
            representing data in bar and pie charts. As the CTO iOS of our
            group, my job was to program the app's back-end software such as
            connecting to Firebase to send and retrieve information.

            User Interface, Swift Language Fundementals and iOS API
            Fundementals. I managed to score 720/1000 for the Swift Test and
            passed.

            <p>
              IMMC was a 5-day competition where a team of students had to
              discuss real-world problems and find efficient solutions to these
              problems using Mathematics and Computing. This year, the problem
              was to find the most efficient way to pack commuters into a
              flight. I was tasked to code a simulation of how commuters would
              be seated in the plane and thus calculates the total time for
              walking, sitting and loading baggage. Multiple challenges were
              faced such as the finding solutions to count the time taken due to
              the complex nature of the issue and my program did not work for
              planes of unique shapes such as the Two-Entrance, Two-Aisle plane.
              Despite these challenges, my team was awarded a Merit.

            <p>
              During my S4 Computing Coursework, me and my team designed a
              Desktop Application using Python which allows students to make
              schedules and facilitate communication between students and
              teachers, Chro-Know. The app used Tkinter to create windows,
              labels and buttons and Firebase was used to sync chat messages
              between accounts and store messages from different accounts. The
              versatile scheduling app allows students to have a better
              allocation of their time and increase productivity.

            <p>
              SUTD-SST Big D Camp was a three-day program where students are
              designated into teams and have to work together to create a
              prototype of an innovation to improve society. On the first day,
              we were taught about Design in Ethics and Sustainability in
              Design, allowing us to consider multiple perspectives when
              designing the prototype. We also learnt how to use the 3D Printer
              and the Laser Cutter to create objects for our prototype. On the
              second day, we worked on the prototype. Our prototype was a mass
              balance with an LCD screen used to find the amount of stock left
              in the shelf. It also came with an app for customers to find out
              the stock. I was in charge of using an Arduino to communicate with
              an online database AdaFruit.IO to be sent to an iOS Application in
              an Xcode Project. On the third day, we had to present how the
              prototype works, the design considerations and target audiences to
              professors from SUTD. Our team managed to achieve the Design
              Excellence Award for excellence in prototype and presentation.

              Singapore Botanic Gardens On-the-Spot Poetry and Photograph
              Competition was an exciting competition. In the first segment, we
              walked around Botanic Gardens and took pictures of the flora and
              fauna around us. After lunch break, we had to choose a photograph
              we had taken and write a poetry about it. It was fun letting my
              imagination go wild and using vivid language to describe the
              scenery around me. However, I did not manage to win anything but
              regardless, was a fun exprience.
