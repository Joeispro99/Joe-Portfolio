        <h3>National Software Competition</h3>
        <p>
          NSC was had 2 segments: an individual quiz to test on basic knowledge
          of Python, a Capture-The-Flag competiton where particpants worked in
          designated teams to solve questions to earn points for their team. The
          event was very fruitful as I was able to meet new people from
          different schools. I clinched a Gold Award for the individual quiz and
          12th Place for the CTF competition

        <h3>Microsoft Imagine Cup Junior</h3>
        <p>
          Microsoft Imagine Cup Junior allows students to innovate and find
          solutions to real-world problems using technology and artificial
          intelligence (AI). As a team, we had to craft out a solution and a
          presentation regarding the workings behind our solution. We achieved a
          Participation Award.

        <p>
          CSA-Cisco Youth Cyber Challenge was a Capture-The-Flag competition
          which features questions about Open Source Intelligence (OSINT),
          Encryption and Decryption and Flags hidden in webpages. This
          competiton was very fun as it felt like a scaveneger hunt quest to
          find the different flags online. I achieved a Participation Award.

          SCGC MUN was a fun experience, allowing me to research about world
          issues such as Accessibility to Education. The experience taught me to
          write a position paper and the proceedings in United Nations
          Conferences. It also allowed me to gain new friendships from people in
          different schools and countries. I achieved Participation Award

        <p>
          SUTD-SST Big D Camp was a three-day program where students are
          designated into teams and have to work together to create a prototype
          of an innovation to improve society. On the first day, we were taught
          about Design in Ethics and Sustainability in Design, allowing us to
          consider multiple perspectives when designing the prototype. We also
          learnt how to use the 3D Printer and the Laser Cutter to create
          objects for our prototype. On the second day, we worked on the
          prototype. Our prototype was a mass balance with an LCD screen used to
          find the amount of stock left in the shelf. It also came with an app
          for customers to find out the stock. I was in charge of using an
          Arduino to communicate with an online database AdaFruit.IO to be sent
          to an iOS Application in an Xcode Project. On the third day, we had to
          present how the prototype works, the design considerations and target
          audiences to professors from SUTD. Our team managed to achieve the
          Design Excellence Award for excellence in prototype and presentation.
