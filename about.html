        <p class="aboutme">
          I am Joe Wong, the ex-CTO of iOS for SST Inc, graduated from St.
          Anthony's Primary School in 2018 and soon to graduate School of
          Science and Technology, Singapore in 2022. <br /><br />
          From a young age of 9, I was exposed to coding and found a huge
          interest in it. Ever since, I always have been searching for new
          things to code such as Robotics, App Development and even Game
          Development. In Secondary 1 and 2, my schoolâ€™s talent development
          programme for coding enabled me with skills to create basic
          applications such as a Contacts List App. Seeing my app work
          completely on my phone was a huge milestone for me and fascinated me
          to learn more about App Development like Google Firebase to link my
          apps to the cloud storage and database. My curiosity fuels my passion
          and love for coding.
