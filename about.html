        I am Joe Wong, the ex-CTO of iOS for SST Inc, graduated from St.
        Anthony's Primary School in 2018 and soon to graduate School of Science
        and Technology, Singapore in 2022. <br /><br />
        From a young age of 9, I was exposed to coding and found a huge interest
        in it. Ever since, I always have been searching for new things to code
        such as Robotics, App Development and even Game Development. In
        Secondary 1 and 2, my schoolâ€™s talent development programme for coding
        enabled me with skills to create basic applications such as a Contacts
        List App. Seeing my app work completely on my phone was a huge milestone
        for me and fascinated me to learn more about App Development like Google
        Firebase to link my apps to the cloud storage and database. My curiosity
        fuels my passion and love for coding.
